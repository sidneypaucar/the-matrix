Each pill navigates the user into their choice, either find out the secrets that lie beyond, or rather remain sane and watch funny videos.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
I managed to learn as I progressed through the project. Past Lectures and classmates were really helpful to me. CSS is always fun to play around with.
### Weaknesses:
React has been difficult to fully comprehend within two weeks. Spent most of my time rewatching lectures to have a better understanding of State and React itself. One small challenge for me was being able to post my data correctly.

### Opportunities:
This project most definitely gave me time to catch up and have a better understanding of React.

### Threats:
I tend to stay on one problem for more than I should. It's like having the answer right in front of you, bbut you can't reach it. Countless hours that could have gone towards styling wasted on a error. I need to know when to move fast a problem and come back to it later.
